Source: https://www.livemint.com/news/india/raghuram-rajan-says-trump-50-per-cent-tariffs-a-wake-up-call-india-us-relationship-has-clearly-broken-down-11756363441219.html

## Core Claims
- Raghuram Rajan believes the 50% tariffs imposed by the US on India are a 'wake-up call'.
- Rajan states the India-US relationship has 'clearly broken down' due to the tariffs.
- Rajan suggests India is disadvantaged by higher base tariffs compared to other Asian countries.
- Rajan attributes the tariffs to Trump's belief that trade deficits indicate other countries are taking advantage of the US.
- Rajan believes the tariffs are a power play by the US, beyond issues of fairness.
## Language & Tone Analysis
The article's language is largely neutral, reporting Rajan's opinions and statements. However, the use of phrases like 'clearly broken down' and 'wake-up call' introduces a slightly opinionated tone, reflecting Rajan's perspective.

## Potential Red Flags
- The article heavily relies on the opinion of a single source (Raghuram Rajan). While he is an expert, the article lacks alternative viewpoints or data to support or refute his claims.
- The headline is somewhat sensationalized, potentially overstating the severity of the situation.
- The article doesn't provide specific data on the tariffs or the India-US trade relationship, relying on Rajan's interpretation.
## Verification Questions
- What specific data supports the claim that India's base tariffs are significantly higher than other Asian countries?
- What are the specific economic impacts of the 50% tariffs on Indian exports to the US?
- What are the US's stated justifications for imposing the tariffs, beyond Rajan's interpretation?
- What alternative perspectives exist regarding the state of the India-US relationship?
## Key Entities to Investigate
- Raghuram Rajan: Investigate his past statements on trade and international relations to identify potential biases.
- United States (specifically Donald Trump's administration): Research the official US trade policy towards India and the rationale behind the tariffs.
- India: Examine the Indian government's response to the tariffs and their strategy for mitigating the impact.
- Reserve Bank of India (RBI): Analyze the RBI's official statements and reports on the India-US trade relationship.
- India Today TV: Investigate the publication's history and potential biases in reporting on economic and political issues.
## Counter-Argument Perspective
From a pro-US trade policy perspective, the article could be seen as biased against the US. A counter-argument might state that the tariffs are a necessary measure to address unfair trade practices by India, protect American jobs, and reduce the trade deficit. It could argue that India has benefited unfairly from access to the US market and that the tariffs are a legitimate tool to level the playing field. The 'wake-up call' is not for India, but for other nations that have taken advantage of the US.
