# Critical Analysis Report for: Raghuram Rajan says Trump 50% tariffs a ‘wake-up call’, India-US relationship has clearly ‘broken down' | Today News

Source: https://www.livemint.com/news/india/raghuram-rajan-says-trump-50-per-cent-tariffs-a-wake-up-call-india-us-relationship-has-clearly-broken-down-11756363441219.html

## Core Claims
- Raghuram Rajan states that the 50% tariffs imposed by the US on India are a "wake-up call."
- Rajan believes the tariffs indicate a breakdown in the India-US relationship.
- Rajan suggests India is disadvantaged due to higher base tariffs compared to other Asian countries.
- Rajan attributes Trump's tariffs to a belief that trade deficits mean other countries are taking advantage of the US.
- Rajan suggests India should reconsider purchasing Russian oil, weighing the benefits against the costs of tariffs.
## Language & Tone Analysis
The article's language is largely neutral, reporting Rajan's opinions and statements. However, the use of phrases like "clearly broken down" and "wake-up call" suggests a slightly negative or concerned tone regarding the India-US relationship.

## Potential Red Flags
- The article relies heavily on the opinions of a single individual (Raghuram Rajan). While he is an expert, the article doesn't present alternative viewpoints or analyses.
- The headline is somewhat sensationalized, emphasizing the "broken down" relationship, which might not be the full picture.
- The article doesn't provide specific data or sources to back up claims about tariff rates in other Asian countries or the profits of Indian refiners.
## Verification Questions
- What specific data supports the claim that India's base tariffs are significantly higher than other Asian countries?
- What are the specific details of the 50% tariffs imposed by the US on India? Which goods are affected?
- What is the actual impact of India's purchase of Russian oil on its trade relationship with the US, according to official trade data?
- What are the alternative perspectives on the India-US trade relationship from other economists or policymakers?
## Key Entities to Investigate
- Raghuram Rajan: Investigate his past statements and potential biases related to trade and international relations.
- Donald Trump: Research his trade policies and statements regarding India and trade deficits.
- United States: Examine official US trade policies and reports regarding India.
- India: Investigate India's trade policies and its relationship with Russia.
- Reserve Bank of India (RBI): Research the RBI's official stance on the India-US trade relationship and the impact of tariffs.
## Counter-Argument Perspective
From a pro-Trump administration perspective, the article could be seen as biased against US trade policies. The tariffs might be presented as a necessary measure to protect American industries and address unfair trade practices by India. The 'broken down' relationship could be framed as a necessary recalibration to ensure fair trade and reciprocity, rather than a complete collapse. India's purchase of Russian oil might be viewed as undermining US efforts to isolate Russia and therefore justifying the tariffs.
